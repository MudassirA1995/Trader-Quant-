## get_pe_ratio()

This function, get_pe_ratio, is designed to calculate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio for a specified stock. The P/E ratio is a financial metric widely used by investors and traders to evaluate the relative value of a company's stock. It represents the relationship between a company's current stock price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Definition of get_pe_ratio
•	Function Input: A stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple).
•	Process: It retrieves data from the Yahoo Finance API via the yfinance library, fetching the current price (current_price) and trailing earnings per share (trailingEps) of the stock.
•	Calculation: The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current_price by eps.
•	Output: The function returns the P/E ratio if available, or None if the required data is missing.
Significance for Traders
For traders, the P/E ratio is essential for comparing the valuation of companies. A high P/E ratio could suggest that the stock is overvalued or that investors expect high growth rates in the future, while a low P/E might indicate undervaluation or slower growth expectations. By analyzing the P/E ratio, traders can make more informed decisions about whether to buy, hold, or sell a stock.
What the Function Covers
•	Fetches Current Price: Retrieves the latest market price of the stock.
•	Fetches EPS: Gathers earnings data, which is essential for calculating the P/E ratio.
•	Handles Data Availability: Includes error handling in case the data for current price or EPS is unavailable for the given ticker, which is common for certain stocks or newly listed companies.
Overall, this function is a practical tool for traders aiming to quickly assess a stock's valuation relative to its earnings, aiding in fundamental analysis and comparison across stocks.

## get_pb_ratio()

Significance of the Financial Metric: Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
The Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is a financial metric that compares a company's market value to its book value. It is calculated as:
P/B=Market Price per ShareBook Value per ShareP/B = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Book Value per Share}}P/B=Book Value per ShareMarket Price per Share
•	Market Price per Share: The current trading price of a single share of the company.
•	Book Value per Share: The value of the company’s net assets (total assets minus liabilities) divided by the total number of outstanding shares.
Why is the P/B Ratio Important?
1.	Valuation Indicator:
o	A low P/B ratio (< 1) may indicate that the stock is undervalued relative to its book value.
o	A high P/B ratio may suggest overvaluation or that investors expect high growth.
2.	Industry-Specific Insight: The P/B ratio is more relevant for asset-heavy industries like banking, real estate, or manufacturing.
3.	Risk Assessment: It provides insights into the company’s financial health and investor sentiment.

### Source Code 


```python

def get_pb_ratio(ticker):
    # Fetch the stock data using yfinance
    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)

        current_price = stock.info['currentPrice']
        
        # Get the book value per share
        book_value_per_share = stock.info['bookValue']
        
        # Calculate the P/B ratio
        pb_ratio = current_price / book_value_per_share
        
        return pb_ratio
    except KeyError:
        print(f"Unable to calculate P/B ratio for {ticker}. Required data not available.")
        return None

# Testing the created function
#print(get_pb_ratio("AAPL"))


```

The function get_pb_ratio retrieves the P/B ratio for a specified stock ticker using the yfinance library. Here's a breakdown:
1.	Input:
o	ticker: The stock's ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.).
2.	Fetching Stock Data:
o	The yfinance library's Ticker object fetches detailed stock information for the specified ticker.
3.	Data Retrieval:
o	The currentPrice and bookValue are extracted from the info dictionary provided by yfinance.

## How the Function Works
1.	Input:
o	ticker: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.).
2.	Fetching Data:
o	The function retrieves financial and balance sheet data for the specified stock using the yfinance library.
3.	Calculating Metrics:
o	Gross Margin: Gross Margin (%)=(Gross ProfitTotal Revenue)×100\text{Gross Margin (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \right) \times 100Gross Margin (%)=(Total RevenueGross Profit)×100
o	Operating Margin: Operating Margin (%)=(Operating IncomeTotal Revenue)×100\text{Operating Margin (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \right) \times 100Operating Margin (%)=(Total RevenueOperating Income)×100
o	Net Profit Margin: Net Profit Margin (%)=(Net IncomeTotal Revenue)×100\text{Net Profit Margin (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \right) \times 100Net Profit Margin (%)=(Total RevenueNet Income)×100
o	Return on Equity (ROE): ROE (%)=(Net IncomeStockholders’ Equity)×100\text{ROE (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Stockholders' Equity}} \right) \times 100ROE (%)=(Stockholders’ EquityNet Income)×100
o	Return on Assets (ROA): ROA (%)=(Net IncomeTotal Assets)×100\text{ROA (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}} \right) \times 100ROA (%)=(Total AssetsNet Income)×100
4.	Data Preparation:
o	The calculated metrics are formatted into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the metric name and its value.
5.	Error Handling:
o	If an error occurs (e.g., missing data), the function catches the exception and returns a descriptive error message.
6.	Output:
o	A list of key profitability metrics, each labeled with its name and rounded to two decimal places.

## get_eps_growth()

## Explanation of the get_eps_growth Function
This function calculates the Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth for a specified stock ticker using historical financial data. EPS Growth is a key indicator used by investors to assess a company’s profitability growth on a per-share basis over time.
________________________________________
## Purpose of the Function
The function provides a way to:
•	Analyze the growth in a company's profitability on a per-share basis over two years.
•	Compare the performance of different companies in terms of earnings growth.
•	Assist in evaluating potential investments by considering historical profitability trends.


## Source Code 

```python

def get_eps_growth(ticker):
    # Download stock data
    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
    try:
        # Fetch net income and shares outstanding data
        financials = stock.financials  # Annual financial statements
        net_income = financials.loc['Net Income'] if 'Net Income' in financials.index else None
        shares_outstanding = stock.info.get("sharesOutstanding")

        # Ensure both values are available for EPS calculation
        if net_income is not None and shares_outstanding:
            # Calculate EPS for the last two years if available
            eps_last_year = net_income.iloc[1] / shares_outstanding
            eps_two_years_ago = net_income.iloc[2] / shares_outstanding
            # Calculate EPS growth
            eps_growth = ((eps_last_year - eps_two_years_ago) / eps_two_years_ago) * 100
            return f"{eps_growth:.2f}% EPS Growth"
        else:
            return "Not enough data to calculate EPS growth."

    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: Could not retrieve EPS growth data for {ticker}. Details: {e}"

```


## How the Function Works
1.	Input:
o	ticker: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.).
2.	Fetching Data:
o	Financials: Retrieves the company's annual financial statements using yfinance.
o	Net Income: Extracts the "Net Income" data from the financial statements.
o	Shares Outstanding: Retrieves the total number of shares outstanding from the stock's metadata.
3.	EPS Calculation:
o	Earnings Per Share (EPS): EPS=Net IncomeShares Outstanding\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}EPS=Shares OutstandingNet Income
o	The function calculates EPS for:
	Last year (eps_last_year).
	Two years ago (eps_two_years_ago).
4.	EPS Growth Calculation:
o	The growth in EPS over the two-year period is calculated as: EPS Growth (%)=(EPS Last Year−EPS Two Years AgoEPS Two Years Ago)×100\text{EPS Growth (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{EPS Last Year} - \text{EPS Two Years Ago}}{\text{EPS Two Years Ago}} \right) \times 100EPS Growth (%)=(EPS Two Years AgoEPS Last Year−EPS Two Years Ago)×100
5.	Data Validation:
o	Checks if both Net Income and Shares Outstanding data are available. If not, returns a message indicating insufficient data.
6.	Error Handling:
o	If an exception occurs (e.g., missing financial data), it returns a descriptive error message.
7.	Output:
o	If successful, returns the EPS Growth as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
o	If data is missing, returns an appropriate error or message.

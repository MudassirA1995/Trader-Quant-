## get_pe_ratio()

This function, get_pe_ratio, is designed to calculate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio for a specified stock. The P/E ratio is a financial metric widely used by investors and traders to evaluate the relative value of a company's stock. It represents the relationship between a company's current stock price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Definition of get_pe_ratio
•	Function Input: A stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple).
•	Process: It retrieves data from the Yahoo Finance API via the yfinance library, fetching the current price (current_price) and trailing earnings per share (trailingEps) of the stock.
•	Calculation: The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current_price by eps.
•	Output: The function returns the P/E ratio if available, or None if the required data is missing.
Significance for Traders
For traders, the P/E ratio is essential for comparing the valuation of companies. A high P/E ratio could suggest that the stock is overvalued or that investors expect high growth rates in the future, while a low P/E might indicate undervaluation or slower growth expectations. By analyzing the P/E ratio, traders can make more informed decisions about whether to buy, hold, or sell a stock.
What the Function Covers
•	Fetches Current Price: Retrieves the latest market price of the stock.
•	Fetches EPS: Gathers earnings data, which is essential for calculating the P/E ratio.
•	Handles Data Availability: Includes error handling in case the data for current price or EPS is unavailable for the given ticker, which is common for certain stocks or newly listed companies.
Overall, this function is a practical tool for traders aiming to quickly assess a stock's valuation relative to its earnings, aiding in fundamental analysis and comparison across stocks.

## get_pb_ratio()

Significance of the Financial Metric: Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
The Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is a financial metric that compares a company's market value to its book value. It is calculated as:
P/B=Market Price per ShareBook Value per ShareP/B = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Book Value per Share}}P/B=Book Value per ShareMarket Price per Share
•	Market Price per Share: The current trading price of a single share of the company.
•	Book Value per Share: The value of the company’s net assets (total assets minus liabilities) divided by the total number of outstanding shares.
Why is the P/B Ratio Important?
1.	Valuation Indicator:
o	A low P/B ratio (< 1) may indicate that the stock is undervalued relative to its book value.
o	A high P/B ratio may suggest overvaluation or that investors expect high growth.
2.	Industry-Specific Insight: The P/B ratio is more relevant for asset-heavy industries like banking, real estate, or manufacturing.
3.	Risk Assessment: It provides insights into the company’s financial health and investor sentiment.
